I've made some fixes to the Makefile and libxxusb.c, both attached, for the Linux 
version of your xxusb product.     They are: 

1. Add -fPIC compiler option to make shared library happy

2. Copy header to /usr/include

3. Detect if 64 bits, and if so copy .so file to /usr/lib64

4. Comment out one unused variable

Would it be possible to include these changes in the tar ball on your web pages? 
I seem to be making these changes over and over on different systems! 
Initial download was from XX-USB_CD5_3 tar file, and xxusb_3.22 Linux version

Also, I might suggest reducing the number of Linux versions, the tar ball is getting  
pretty big!
