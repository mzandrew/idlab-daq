--  ERR_DETECT_4BYTE
--
--
--  Description : The ERR_DETECT module monitors the GTX to detect hard errors.
--                It accumulates the Soft errors according to the leaky bucket
--                algorithm described in the Aurora Specification to detect Hard
--                errors.  All errors are reported to the Global Logic Interface.
