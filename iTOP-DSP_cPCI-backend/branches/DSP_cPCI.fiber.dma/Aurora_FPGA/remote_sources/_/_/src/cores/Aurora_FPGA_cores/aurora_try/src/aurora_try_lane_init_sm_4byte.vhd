--
--
--  Description: This logic manages the initialization of the GTX in 2-byte mode.
--               It consists of a small state machine, a set of counters for
--               tracking the progress of initializtion and detecting problems,
--               and some additional support logic.

    -- the machine will spend at least 8 cycles in reset, 256 in ALIGN and 32 in REALIGN.

    -- The counter is implemented seperately from the main counter because it is required
    -- to stop counting when it reaches the end of its count.  Adding this functionality

    -- The counter is implemented as a shift register extending counter 1.  The counter
    -- clears out in all non-ack cycles by keeping CE asserted.  When it gets into the
    -- ack state, CE is asserted only when there is a transition on the most
    -- significant bit of counter 1.  This happens every 128 cycles.  We count out 32 of
    -- these transitions to get a count of approximately 4096 cycles.  The actual
    -- number of cycles is less than this because we don't reset counter1, so it
    -- starts off about 34 cycles into its count.
