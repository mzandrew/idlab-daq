--  SYM_DEC_4BYTE
--
--
--  Description: The SYM_DEC_4BYTE module is a symbol decoder for the
--               4-byte Aurora Lane.  Its inputs are the raw data from
--               the GTX.  It word-aligns the regular data and decodes
--               all of the Aurora control symbols.  Its outputs are the
--               word-aligned data and signals indicating the arrival of
--               specific control characters.
