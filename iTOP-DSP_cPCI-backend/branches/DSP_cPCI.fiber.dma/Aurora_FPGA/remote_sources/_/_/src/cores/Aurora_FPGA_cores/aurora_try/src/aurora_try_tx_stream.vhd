--  TX_STREAM
--
--
--  Description: The TX_STREAM module converts user data from a streaming interface
--               to Aurora Data, then sends it to the Aurora Channel for transmission.
--               To perform streaming with Aurora, it starts an infinite frame after
--               channel up and performs opporunistic clock correction automatically
--
--               This module supports 2 4-byte lane designs
