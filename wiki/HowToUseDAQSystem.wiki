#summary How to use the 2011 cosmic / beam test bPID/iTOP data acquisition system

=Introduction=

A thorough description of the electronics and system for 2011 cosmic / beam test is available at [http://www.phys.hawaii.edu/~kurtisn/documentation/bPID_electronics/ bPID electronics documentation].

==Hardware==

===DSP_cPCI===

The DSP_cPCI revB board has 4 multigigabit/s fiber optic transceivers, 3 FPGAs, 4 dual-core digital signal processors (DSPs) and 256MiB of SDRAM per DSP.

==Software==

===kernel driver===

The kernel driver (altix.ko) is loaded at boot time if a DSP_cPCI board is present.

===shared library===

Some parts of the software to deal with data from the DSP_cPCI board are organized into a library (libaltix.so).

===userland programs===

Programs written to interface with the DSP_cPCI board must
{{{
#include altix_userland.h
#include libaltix.h
}}}
and get linked with libaltix.so via:
{{{
-laltix
}}}
as long as libaltix.so is in the library path.
